// AppModel — the app's one piece of real logic: connect Tavily over MCP, let the user pick any
// registered LOCAL model (Apple on-device, or a downloaded MLX open-weight model — no cloud
// providers; a search backend other than Tavily, e.g. Brave/Exa, is a config option for later,
// not built yet), and run searches as topic threads.
//
// Refinement, in one paragraph: an earlier version had the model itself decide whether a new
// query continued the current topic or started a fresh one, silently expanding an ambiguous
// follow-up ("last ceo") using the thread's earlier turns. Confirmed live that this fails exactly
// where it matters most — that exact query, inside a Yahoo thread, got grounded to Tim Cook
// instead, silently, with no way to notice short of reading the tiny subtitle. So there is no
// automatic grounding or topic classification anymore. The composer leaves each submitted query
// sitting in the box (editable) instead of clearing it — the user edits it directly ("last ceo" →
// "yahoo last ceo") or hits the clear button to start a genuinely new topic, and *that* explicit
// action, not a model guess, is what decides whether the next search extends `activeThreadID` or
// starts a new one. Every search is a fresh, stateless `LocalLMLabSession` — nothing here relies
// on conversational memory inside the model any more.
